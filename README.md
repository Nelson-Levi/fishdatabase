## Overview

**Project Title**: Levi's Fish Database

**Project Description**: This program is for my personal use. It allows users to log information about fish they've caught, where, and with what tackle! Data is stored inside of a Firebase Realtime Database. Users may also retrieve fish information from the database, and read about previous catches!

**Project Goals**:
1. Demonstrate understanding of React, a framework I've never used before.
2. Understand writing and retrieving data from cloud databases, such as Firebase.
3. Refresh JavaScript abilities.

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Install React in the fishdatabase directory with: npm install.
3. Start the app with the command: npm start.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Choose between reading or writing fish data to the database.
2. For writing data, supply all required fields and publish to the database.
3. For reading data, supply name and date, and retrieve information.
